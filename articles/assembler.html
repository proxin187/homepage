            <h1>What i have learnt so far creating an assembler in Rust!</h1>
            <p>
                Recently i decided i should try to write my own assembler, this is
                an interesting topic as i love low level concepts and so far in my computer
                journey i have had little knowledge about machine code.
                <br>

            <h1>Project Setup</h1>
            <p>
                First i started by initalizing an empty rust project with the following folder structure
            </p>

            <h1>Parsing assembly</h1>
            <p>
                The first obstacle of writing an assembler is parsing the assembly,
                thankfully i have experience with writing compilers so this was an easy
                task.
                <br>
                <br>
                I started by creating a lexer which would allow me to retrieve lexed
                lines when i wanted trough the `next_line` function, i achieved this by
                having a structure with a BufReader to the source file, i could then use
                the `read_line` function from `std::io::BufRead` to read line-by-line
                from our source file.
                <br>
                <br>
                Long story short, i implemented a very simple lexer and parsed it into
                an enum which called `Inst` as it represented an x86_64 instuction.
            </p>

            <h1>ModR/M Encoding</h1>
            <p>
                The next obstacle would be a little harder, i had to figure out how
                x86_64 instructions where encoded, this was new to me as i had never
                worked with bytecode before, in addition this i had a hard time understanding the
                <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/technical/intel-sdm.html">intel programmers manual</a>
                due to its formal nature.
                <br>
                <br>
                After a good amount of research i managed to cook up a function that would
                encode ModR/M with the mod, reg and rm parameters. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ModR/M">Wikipedia</a> had a really great
                illustration that made it alot easier to understand so i must give them
                credit where its due.
            </p>

            <pre>
                // page 44 @ intel programmers manual
                fn format_modrm(mod_: u8, reg: u8, rm: u8) -&gt; u8 {
                    (mod_ &lt;&lt; 6) | (reg &lt;&lt; 3) | rm
                }
            </pre>

            <h1>Summary</h1>
            <p>
                Writing an assembler in rust was a very great way to learn the x86_64 architecture,
                i would definetly recomend the reader to give it a try as its both great for learning
                and for fun.
                <br>
                <br>
                I need to note that this article only scratches the surface of assemblers and
                while creating the assembler i faced many problems i never mentioned in this article,
                in addition to this, i have an idea in the back of my head to maybe create a x86_64 emulator
                as i now know x86_64 instructions are encoded, this would be a fun task but ill leave that for later.
